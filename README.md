# Introduction to PropTypes in React

## Introduction

Type Checking is a process of verifying that a piece of code is using the correct data types for variables, function parameters and return values. In the context of React applications, we are going to use PropTypes to do that job.

PropTypes is a way to type check the props that a React component receives. It helps to catch potential type errors during development, making it easier to spot and fix bugs. 

## Project Overview

This project is a demo of how to use PropTypes in React.

*   Setting up PropTypes.
*   Using common PropTypes features.

## Getting Started

To start using PropTypes in our React projects, we first need to install the corresponding library. We can do that with `npm`. In your React project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save prop-types
